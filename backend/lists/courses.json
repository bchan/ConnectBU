Reference to art historical models directs an exploration of perceptual and conceptual approaches to representational painting.

A deep-dive investigation into masks as universal but complex, culturally-embedded phenomena provides students in the course with a unique lens. Students investigate the popularity of masks in global contemporary art and the roots of these masks that speak to culture, identity, privacy, and other issues of the moment. Responding to course content by creating art, students stretch and expand their knowledge of the mask form and use it as a tool to examine pressing issues in the contemporary art classroom. The in-depth focus enriches the background, ideas, and approaches teachers can bring to mask making, a valuable but often challenging project, but also use as a model. Through e-portfolio and online discussions, students create a community of learners.

The course will offer opportunities to reflect on the various conceptions of a child that will guide educational practices from behavioral psychologists to artists and educators. The learners will engage in discussions, critical reading and writing, visual presentations, and qualitative inquiry to demonstrate their understanding of the psychological, cultural, and artistic development of children and adolescents. The theories of foundational developmental psychologists Piaget and Vygotsky will be considered as well as the theories of artistic development put forth by Lowenfeld, Burton, Golomb, Wilson, and others.

We shall not, however, exclude the  possibility of bolstering our perceptions through background reading of recent  and earlier literature -- analytic, historic, and hermeneutic.

Because, he said in  his still highly Germanic syntax, \"In Mozart everything is to hear, but not to  see.\" In this seminar, we'll try to get at what \"is to hear\" in Mozart: by  listening to the music, intently and repeatedly, in recordings and, if possible,  live performances; and in equally intensive discussion of what we hear -- free- floating discussion that will follow only the directions of the participants'  interest and exclude no possibility a priori. We shall not, however, exclude the  possibility of bolstering our perceptions through background reading of recent  and earlier literature -- analytic, historic, and hermeneutic.  We shall not attempt anything like a survey. Indeed, I imagine we'll devote  attention to only a handful of pieces. I do not have an advance list of these  (although I do have my favorites) -- I will be grateful if participants will  send me suggestions before our first meeting. ",

This section of the survey focuses on the third generation of American independent feature filmmaking in the period running from approximately 2000 to the present. Since women have made some of the best and most important works in this area, as many female filmmakers as possible are being included. Offered in the fall of even numbered years.",

The course is designed for students who have edited a number of exercises  and films in previous classes.  It provides an opportunity for students to  develop advanced editing skills, while learning advanced digital editing  techniques on the Avid Media Composer.  This is an advanced editing class,  and not a course on how to use Avid. By editing scenes from episodic  television shows, and other professionally shot footage, students will learn  how to select (and reject) material, where and when to cut, how to create  pace, how to control what the audience sees and does not see, how to add  music and effects to increase the emotional content, and how to use visual  effects to enhance the impact of the material.",

        "description": "Modern research in the life sciences is an increasingly interdisciplinary  endeavor where new fields of study have developed at the interfaces of  biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computer science.  In many  instances, the development of these new fields goes hand in hand with  development of new experimental approaches to surveying the content of the  cell.  While, traditional molecular cell biology and biochemistry courses  often focus on the basic details of cell physiology and macromolecular (DNA,  lipid, protein) structures, they too often neglect the quantitative aspects  of number, scale, forces, etc. that are crucial to providing a larger  context within living systems.   This course aims at reframing the basic  concepts of cell and molecular biology in a quantitative context and  providing a basic overview of some of the key approaches used to develop a  quantitative framework inside the cell.  How this detailed information can  then be applied to bioinformatics research problems will also be explored.",

After commencing briefly with   general introductory material (published reviews and other relevant   background information), we proceed to examine, discuss and evaluate recent   papers that directly illustrate the use of bioinformatics either in pre-  clinical or clinical research settings. Papers will be drawn from high-  impact journals such as Nature, Science, PNAS, Cell, and Science   Translational Medicine. Students take turns presenting the papers to the   class and provide brief critical reviews of each, both orally and in   writing. They will also complete a term paper in the form of a research   proposal directed to the goal of using bioinformatics to advance a medical   intervention -- prognostic, diagnostic or therapeutic. Brief guest   presentations by researchers working in BUSM (or BU Main Campus)   laboratories will be arranged as appropriate.  Previous guest facilitators   have included faculty from the Department of Biostatistics, the Section of   Computational Biomedicine, and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics   as well as leading industrial research laboratories.

We also  discuss solution selection techniques. We then work on implementing our  ideas into systems and verify that they address the product requirements and  fulfill the concept we started with. During the class, we go over how to  choose solutions to build our products. We also discuss real product  realization, implementations and tradeoffs. The class is taught via an  example product and the class sessions are interactive.

Disaster response is a complicated multi-institutional operation requiring sophisticated planning, logistics and communications. Response planning emphasizes the interface and coordination requirements of the National Response Framework. Recovery involves all the necessary actions to reinstate normal operations including reconstitution of necessary data, hardware, software, personnel, supplies and facilities. Recovery actions are focused on issues and decisions that occur after immediate response needs are addressed. Current and proposed Federal, state, local and private nonprofit disaster recovery methods are discussed. This course addresses these issues through discussion of the cycle of planning, training, equipping, exercising and mission continuity processes and reviewing case studies of current and past governmental and private methods. 3 cr",

Machine learning is so pervasive today that we probably    use it dozens of times a day without even knowing it. Many researchers also    think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level artificial    intelligence. In this day and age, it is therefore critical that we expose    BUSM students and trainees to this exciting area  and educate them in this   field. An introductory course such as this one is  positioned to train the   next generation of biomedical engineers and  scientists to face data-driven   challenges in the coming  decades. The main feature of this course is that   students will learn by  doing! We will bring machine learning to life by   showing fascinating use  cases in biomedical sciences and tackling   interesting real-world problems  like disease risk assessment and predictive   modeling. When students complete  this introductory course, they will be in   a position to analyze several  types of biomedical datasets using machine   learning techniques.  4 cred. Fall",

In April of 2018, Massachusetts joined 44 states and the federal government in providing a statutory mechanism by which terminally ill and/or permanently incapacitated inmates could be released on so-called medical parole. The new statute was a result of ongoing compromises as part of the omnibus criminal justice reform bill, and pending constitutional litigation which became moot. To date only one person has been released. The intent of the practicum is to engage students both in direct representation of inmates not otherwise entitled to counsel, and in brainstorming and developing solutions in this new and rapidly developing area of law. Students will learn about legislative history and lobbying, about statutory construction, FOIA, and about the constitutional underpinnings of compassionate release. Students will learn and demonstrate drafting, client counseling and negotiation skills. This practicum can be taken for one (50 hours) or two (100 hours) graded credits. Students will write a total of twenty pages, which likely will include a petition for release, and a superior court complaint and motion for judgment on the pleadings. Students will in addition write two journal reflections. There will be a weekly one hour seminar at a time arranged with the students.

This seminar will examine the legal tools available to address climate change and possibilities for future action, as well as related challenges in light of the current political landscape. The seminar first will consider the international context and review the history of climate change efforts on a global scale, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the 2015 Paris Agreement. It will then focus on currently available U.S. authorities, including the Clean Air Act and executive branch powers, and on state and local efforts. Because there is no statute that addresses climate change head-on, the seminar will consider the challenges presented when a major policy concern is advanced in the absence of a firm statutory foundation. Climate change also raises important issues of human rights, environmental justice, and international and intergenerational equity, which will be examined. Finally, the seminar will look to the future and pose questions concerning expectations for international cooperation and possible developments in U.S. law and policy. There are no prerequisites.

Where do they get their powers?  What are the limits?  What should be the limits?  This course provides a study of the law governing the powers and duties of local governments, mainly municipal corporations such as cities and towns. We look at the sources of municipal powers, the limits on those powers, the relationship between municipalities and the state including the relationship between state and local law, and the formation and expansion of municipalities. An important subject of study involves looking at various models of the relationship between the municipality and the state including home rule.

This course will introduce students to family law as a dynamic field of law concerning a basic social institution: the family. Family law is a foundational course relevant to many areas of law practice. Students will gain knowledge about how family law intersects with many other fields of law, such as contracts, constitutional law, conflicts of laws, criminal law, property, tax, torts, and trusts and estates, as well as how social science informs family law. This course will also consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families and areas of family law doctrine and practice. The course will focus on marriage (including the recognition of same-sex marriage), nonmarital families, divorce, pathways to becoming a parent, and the parent-child relationship. Topics include defining and regulating marriage; formal marriage; common law marriage; nonmarital couples, cohabitation, and alternatives to marriage (such as domestic partnerships); common law incidents of marriage and transformation of the common law; domestic violence; traditional and \"no fault\" divorce; property division; spousal support; child support; child custody; and regulating parenthood. Students will be introduced to the role of negotiation, mediation, and other forms of dispute resolution in the practice of family law. There will be a final examination.

This course examines the historical, social and legal foundations for our current system.  We will examine the issue of \"rights\" as applied to children and look at the effects of ideology and politics on the current juvenile justice system.  How have assumptions of childhood and responsibility changed?  Has the juvenile court been \"criminalized\" with the introduction of due process rights for children?  Under what circumstances are children treated as adult offenders?  Selected issues for inquiry include: police interrogation of juveniles; school safety and zero tolerance policies; adjudicative competency; anti-youth crime policies; conditions of incarceration; and changes brought about by elimination of mandatory juvenile life without parole.  We will examine these issues through use of court cases, law review articles, governmental and private organizational position papers, and legislative history.  Using the Massachusetts model, one of the early and often emulated juvenile systems, we will examine the changes in the prosecution and incarceration of juveniles over the past century.  As we consider the overarching issue of whether it makes sense to maintain a separate justice system for juveniles, we will compare our system to those of other nations.  We will visit the  Boston Juvenile Court to observe a delinquency session and speak with court personnel.  Students are expected to attend each class prepared to discuss the assigned readings.  Course requirements include a 15-20 page final paper, a class presentation based on the paper topic or related class readings, and several assigned reading response papers over the course of the semester.

This course builds on first-year courses in Constitutional Law and Civil Procedure and complements upperclass courses on modern public law and legal institutions: e.g., Administrative Law, Immigration Law, Environmental Law, Labor Law, and Conflict of Laws. Topics include the separation of federal legislative and judicial powers, Congress' authority to prescribe the federal courts' jurisdiction and to assign adjudicatory duties to other bodies (e.g., \"legislative\" courts and agencies), standing to litigate in federal court, conflicts between federal and state courts, the states' immunity from private lawsuits, the Supreme Court's authority to review state court judgments, and \"abstention\" doctrines governing the exercise of federal judicial power.  We will explore theoretical and policy questions--asking not only what federal-courts law is at the moment, but also what it should be.  Yet we will organize our discussions around practical lawyering in the federal courts--identifying and analyzing the constitutional, statutory, and judge-made hurdles that litigants must clear to obtain a decision on the merits of a federal question.

This course is designed for students who have already had some exposure to human rights law, whether in the context of a law degree or in some other context. The course aims to deepen students' engagement with this field of law and to enrich their capacity for critical analysis and theoretical enquiry.  The seminar begins with an introduction to key concepts in human rights, including universalism, cultural relativism and the historical development of human rights in modern Europe.  It examines human rights law-making in European (regional) institutional frameworks of the European Union and the Council of Europe, before moving on to examine several national contexts.  The remaining sessions of the seminar examine human rights issues by way of illustrative groups of cases and supported by secondary literature that examines the social, economic and political contexts in which these cases are set. The issues covered in these cases in context include, e.g., asylum, race, sexuality, protections against torture and inhumane treatment, the right to life, the right to manifest religious belief, the right to education, and the right to family life.  While human rights advocacy generally adopts a universalist, pro-rights posture, this course seeks to complicate the idea of the benevolence of rights by critically engaging with human rights law in context.  **A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.

The primary focus is on civil rights litigation in federal courts against state officials under the civil rights statutes passed in the wake of the civil war, including 42 U.S.C. ? ?1983, 1981, 1982 and 1985 on the civil side and 18, U.S.C. ?? 242 and 249 on the criminal side. The criminal segment of the course will be taught by an Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the Public Corruption and Special Prosecutions Unit and the Civil Rights Enforcement Team in the District of Massachusetts.  Criminal issues include prosecutions of police officers for violating the civil rights of arrestees and hate crimes.  On the civil side, we will examine the rights that give rise to civil rights action and, to a lesser extent, the scope of those rights. The kinds of cases include police brutality, unlawful searches and seizures and discrimination in government jobs. The issues that arise include many statutory questions, such as identification of proper parties to 1983 actions, and judge-make defenses, such as official and state immunities from damages actions and injunctive suits. We will also look at federalism and eleventh amendment limitations on congressional power and federal court remedial power in 1983 actions, although coverage of these issues will not be as thorough as in Federal Courts. The standards for holding local governments liable for damages will also be examined. Our major foray into the substance of constitutional rights will be with regard to the role of state remedies and defendant's state of mind for fourteenth amendment procedural due process violations. We will also look at substantive constitutional rights such as police brutality, medical care for prisoners and detainees, high speed police chases and other similar areas. There will also be some coverage of remedies against federal officials directly under the constitution and remedies against  private individuals for civil rights violations.

The course will review Federal and State statutes, regulations, as well as case law relevant to hospital organization, responsibilities and liability, credentialing, fraud and abuse laws and compliance oversight.   The course is intended to develop competencies in understanding health care and health care insurance laws and regulations as they pertain to hospitals, developing familiarity with the reimbursement (particularly Medicare & Medicaid), regulatory compliance and enforcement issues facing hospital counsel.   In addition, it is expected that students will demonstrate legal analysis and reasoning, problem-solving and communications skills required for work in a hospital/health care setting.  Through understanding core health care law principles, students will learn the foundational legal, structural and business aspects of the modern hospital complex.  Understanding how hospitals fit into the broader health care environment of payors, physicians, patients, regulators and other health care providers, law students will be able to appreciate the challenging dynamics affecting the health care system and the role of the hospital, often at the hub of activity, both in terms of current practice, but also health care delivery system reform.  After completing the class, students will have been exposed to the key health care-related legal issues facing hospitals that hospital counsel and other health care lawyers need to know.  Additionally, recognition of these stressors will be important training for lawyers in other disciplines interacting with hospitals, such as labor and employment law, intellectual property, antitrust, criminal defense, environmental, corporate, employee benefits, tax, etc.  Course materials include a case book, primary source documentation, and guest lectures from in-house and outside counsel representing hospitals.

Over the course of the semester, students will gain a critical understanding of how doctrines of positive rights, conduct, privacy, and equal protection have shaped views on gender and sexual orientation across time, and how the latter have likewise shaped the former. Looking through the lens of modern legislation, litigation, and the lived experiences of LGBTQ people in the United States, students will develop their own theories of law regarding gender and sexual orientation--theories of law that will hopefully be applicable throughout their careers as legal professionals.",

        "description": "This course will examine federal (and some state) laws that protect and incentivize whistleblowers to provide information and assist in the enforcement of laws prohibiting fraud and misfeasance in both the public and private sectors.     There are two types of whistleblower laws, and the seminar will cover both:  1) laws which protect whistleblowers inside and outside of government from retaliation by employers for having engaged in protected activity (e.g., the government employee who filed the anonymous complaint that led to President Trump's impeachment) and 2) laws which provide financial incentives to whistleblowers for reporting fraud against the government, or fraud in the securities and commodities markets.   The course will examine the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) and the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA), the primary tools that protect whistleblowers inside of government from speaking up about government malfeasance. We will use as a specific case study the government whistleblower whose complaint led to the impeachment of the President, and the President's attempts to force disclosure of his/her identity. We will also study the policies of the Securities & Exchange Commission, which provide that the Commission considers retaliation against complainants to be a matter of enforcement priority and which prohibit the use of releases of liability or waivers of rights to whistleblowing activity in employment severance and termination agreements.  In the second category, the course will include a study of the federal False Claims Act - the Government's primary law enforcement mechanism for prosecuting financial frauds against the Government and its unique \"qui tam\" provisions which authorize private citizens to participate in that effort and offer a reward for successfully pursuing a case on the Government's behalf. The False Claims Act was substantially revised in 1986 to address modern problems of fraud against the Government. Since 1986, the Government has recovered over $50 billion as a result of cases initiated by private citizens. The course will also study the SEC and CFTC whistleblower programs, established through the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. Current trends and developing case law in these programs will be examined, and we will undertake a detailed comparison of these models to the False Claims Act's qui tam provisions. Finally, we will look at the Internal Revenue Code's reward system for reporting tax fraud -- and why it has not fared as well as the SEC and CFTC programs.  In addition, each student will write a paper based on a personal interview with one or more whistleblowers who have gone through the experience and/or whistleblower attorneys who have a substantial practice in this area.   The course will be taught predominantly through simulated problems, based on composites of actual cases. By using these simulated problems, students will gain professional practice skills, including drafting, negotiating, and client representation. Students will work on a final project or paper, involving analyzing and proposing solutions to a current policy issue, or analyzing an actual whistleblower case.

For good reason, we call this the Information Age. Recall the countless high-profile privacy and data security controversies you have heard about in the last year: location tracking; inaccurate credit reports causing lost jobs; data breaches, hacking and identity theft; and government surveillance. Law has responded with a dizzying array of new rules -- and a rapidly growing area of professional specialization for attorneys. This course serves as an introduction to the emerging law of data privacy. By the end, you will be well grounded in many challenges facing any enterprise, public or private, that collects, processes, uses, and stores personal information. In addition to knowledge of constitutional, statutory, and common law rules as well as federal and state enforcement activity, we will learn about the policy questions that arise in this dynamic area, the legally relevant questions to ask when assessing information practices, and some of the many nonlegal models of information governance. You will gain a basic understanding of data privacy regulation in other countries, particularly the European Union. All students will benefit from more sophisticated knowledge about an issue that appears in the news every single day. But there are significant professional payoffs too. Major law firms have organized entire practice areas devoted to privacy and data protection law. In the last seven years the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP), a key trade association in this space, more than tripled in size to 12,000 members. These trends mean that law school graduates will have increasing job opportunities in data privacy and security law. Meanwhile, in many other practice areas -- such as securities, labor and employment, health, advertising, and the list goes on -- familiarity with privacy and security law has become a major asset. Plus, the issues are fascinating and fun. If nothing else, you can have great conversations at parties. ",

Topics vary from year to year, depending on the speakers, but have included:  anti-discrimination law, criminal law,  elder law, employment law (including sexual harassment law), First Amendment (speech and religion), gender identity issues (including transgender rights), health law, international human rights, the intersection of race and gender, law and sexuality, masculinity studies, privacy law, regulation of family, marriage, and parenthood, reproductive justice and reproductive rights, and gender-based violence.

The course will teach the tax differences between copyrighting and patenting a software program, the right and wrong ways to license and sell a trademark, and the mechanisms for turning a \"license\" into a \"sale\" and thereby converting ordinary income into capitol gains.

The course will also compare and contrast these movements in America with other countries, as US-headquartered companies expanding abroad face new realities, unfamiliar tax structures and increasingly complex regulatory environments; and legal and tax professionals must be prepared for these challenges. Rather than focus on technology per se, analyzing computer programming language and codes, the bias of this course is the real-life business perspective of technology when applied to taxation and fiscal policy.  This course gives students exclusive access to tax software actually used by multinational corporations to determine indirect taxes in the US and nearly 200 other countries and foreign tax jurisdictions. This access will allow students to simulate domestic/international transactions and analyze their tax implications while becoming familiar with the mechanics of an Enterprise-class tax automation solution.",

The course has two  primary focuses: 1) to explore and evaluate major explanations or theories of  crime and 2) understand and evaluate the policy implications of major crime  problems. Because criminology is interdisciplinary, students will examine  theories that are grounded in a range of academic perspectives, including  sociological, biological, political, psychological and economic explanations for  crime. These theories will be centered on important public policy debates about  a host of contemporary problems, including: firearm violence, high post- incarceration recidivism, opioid use disorder crisis and human trafficking.  Course lectures and discussions focus on the historical development of the  theories, their major assumptions and propositions, their relevance for public  policy and practice. As the course progresses through each explanation for  crime, students will have the opportunity to critically evaluate the validity of  different explanations for crime as well as criminal justice policies and  practices that they support.",

Effective Fall 2020, this course  fulfills a single unit in each of  the following areas: Research and  Information Literacy; Writing, Research and Inquiry.   EN 201 - A1 (Bennett) -- \"Contemporary Fiction's Otherworldly Glow\"  In this course, our reading will take us to Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Latin  America, regions more culturally different than some might imagine. Our close reading, however,  will reinforce the universality of the human condition as we examine issues of race, class, gender,  and ethnicity. We will encounter colonialism, war, love, and political intrigue in four twenty- first century novels: Taiye Selasi's Ghana Must Go, Hala Alyan's Salt Houses, Kiran Desai's The  Inheritance of Loss, and Luis Alberto Urrea's The House of Broken Angels.  EN 201 - A2 (Grabianowski) -- \"Imagining Ourselves, Imagining the Landscape, Imagining Technology\"   Can humans muster the imagination and the ethical grit necessary to create a sustainable and  livable future where freedom, equality and human rights are respected? How can scientific insight,  technological advancement, business interests and the humanities find common ground in creating  such a world? Could revisiting the powers of imagination provide some answers? Could insights  derived from thousands of years of living in a natural landscape help humans to better understand  the opportunities and limitations of our current technological landscape? In this section of  English 201, we will consider what insights the long history of the imagination can offer us into  the awe-inspiring wonders of nature and how they have contributed to unlocking the hidden  capacities of the human mind. We will first take a look at the deep currents of imagination going  back to the ancient philosophers like Heraclitus. We will then, over the course of the semester,  consider how 19th and 20th century poets, novelists, theoretical physicists and environmentalists  like Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Wordsworth, S.T. Coleridge, E.M. Forster, Gary Snyder, Albert  Einstein, David Bohm, and Aldo Leopold have addressed the practical and ethical issues that arise  at the intersection of nature, technology and society. Based on student interests, the background  of these texts will allow us to shine new light on the social, environmental and technological  issues of our day like cyborgs and the future of AI, the ethics of genetic engineering, machines  with human purposes, big data, human relationships in the age of social media and fake news, the  failures of modern education, and the rise of sustainability and ecological economics. We will  discuss how contemporary scientists, poets, technology industry leaders, and writers like Herman  Daly and Sherry Turkle seek to rediscover in a modern context how we can forge deeper and more  meaningful relationships with ourselves, nature, and each other by re-discovering the capacities of  our innate imaginative powers to grapple with the rapid transformation of our technological  existence. We will harness these perspectives to think critically about writing itself as a  technology and about how understanding it better can draw us nearer to the finer points of the  writing process.  ",

Given the  complexity and dynamics of the health care environment, an understanding of  related issues at all levels is essential for effective communication and  prevention of error within health care organizations. Without it, organizations  must react defensively to environmental and political threats, often at the  expense of patient safety and well-being; with it, organizations can act  strategically to maximize growth opportunities and anticipate those forces that  influence policy. The course draws upon multiple perspectives, including health  communication in medicine and public health, health management (access, quality,  and cost), politics, healthcare ethics, law, and the complexities of cross- cultural and psychosocial considerations within today's healthcare system.

The efficacy of the use of visual symbols has also been  recognized for bridging language barriers in health care settings.  This course  provides health communication professionals the fundamental principles of design  and how these relate to effective communication, particularly in health  education and delivery applications. Course lectures and resources will guide  students from visual design theory, straight through content creation and  measuring effectiveness of visual messaging.   Students will explore various  media and tools used to create digital images and get hands-on practice in the  image editing process. Topics include conceptual design, critical thinking in  the creation of practical design, how design relates to industry, human  perception and the visual process, and the use of symbols for immediacy and to  bridge cultural and literacy divides.  In addition to exploring popular digital  vehicles for visual storytelling, such as infographics, data visualization,  video and mobile, the course will also present real- world challenges, such as  ethics and regulations in digital communications, as well as business processes.

Both positive and negative definitions of racial and ethnic  identities delimit access to and use of different foodstuffs and  preparations. In this class we explore these processes, focusing  particularly on North America. We will read widely in the literature, paying  close attention to intersectional scholarship to understand how limitations  related to race, ethnicity, class, religion, gender and sexuality reinforce  each other and are also challenged and resisted together. Students will be  responsible for participating in and sometimes leading discussion,  completing regular writing assignments and designing and completing a  semester-long research project.   Topic for Fall 2020 Section A2,  \"Sociology of Taste\":  Taste has an undeniable personal immediacy:  producing visceral feelings ranging from delight to disgust. As a result, in  our everyday lives we tend to think about taste as purely a matter of  individual preference. However, for sociologists, our tastes are not only  socially meaningful, they are also socially determined, organized, and  constructed. This course will introduce students to the variety of questions  sociologists have asked about taste. What is a need? Where do preferences  come from? What social functions might our tastes serve? Major theoretical  perspectives for answering these questions will be considered, examining the  influence of societal institutions, status seeking behaviors, internalized  dispositions, and systems of meaning on not only what we enjoy--but what we  find most revolting.",

We will read, research and write food history to explore the ways in which the  history of food has shaped our world today, paying careful attention to  structural inequalities that restrict food access.

In addition,  students will examine cookbooks and recipes as social documents that reveal  the presence of social and economic hierarchies, networks and alliances, and  political, economic, and religious structures.

Spearheaded by Rebecca Alssid,   Julia Child, and Jacques Pe\u0301pin, this intensive, semester-long program  was  developed to expose students to classic French and American techniques,   baking, international cuisines, sustainability, and many more subjects. The   unique program merges the best aspects of traditional culinary arts study   with the hands-on tutelage of a wide range of chefs-- augmented by insight   into the food industry as a whole. This model allows students to enter a   wide variety of jobs related to food as well as continue their education in   the Gastronomy Program. Boston University's full-time culinary arts program-  -entering its third decade--is taught entirely by working chefs and experts   in the food industry.  The goals of this program are to:  *  Expose dedicated culinary students of all ages to the best  professional  chefs and teachers in the world of cooking  * Train students in the  basic classical and modern techniques and  theories of food production   * Introduce students to various cultures through their cuisines ",

Here, lectures will cover optimal  investment and duality for general semi-martingale models; and portfolio  optimization and pricing in Markovian factor models, non-Markovian Brownian  models, models with trading constraints, and models with transactions costs.  Throughout this half, lectures will highlight connections to the dynamic  programming principle, the Martingale optimality principle, semi-linear Cauchy  partial differential equations, backward stochastic differential equations, and  the theory of viscosity solutions.",

These psychological insights are particularly useful for marketing strategy, brand positioning, and marketing communication decisions, but also yield insight into common biases in judgment and decision making, beyond marketing, to which you would otherwise fall prey. Why people are willing to drive across town to save $5 on a tank of gasoline, for example, when they would not drive a minute to save $5 on a refrigerator. We will discuss some of these applications in class. In addition, we will examine the methodology of market research (specific to consumer behavior) to build the tools you will need to interpret and base decisions on it. Readings will include primary empirical research articles (e.g., Journal of Consumer Research articles), business journal articles, and research reviews (e.g., Harvard Business Review articles).

Societal and business imperatives are not only   often considered  compatible; they can be increasingly viewed as one and the   same. People today  often communicate, organize and engage based on mutual   interests, and,  generally, place greater trust in organizations and   individuals that work for a  better world. Marketing has often been referred to   as the \"science of sales.\"  Whether you are selling a product, an intervention   or an idea, it can be a  powerful tool for advancing social change in today's   dynamic environment. The  strategic integration of a relevant social purpose   into a product, business or  nonprofit organization through brand-building   citizenship activities can drive  consumer and donor recall, consideration,   acquisition, retention and propensity  to recommend. However, these efforts do   not usually constitute a \"silver bullet\"  and may not be the best solution to a   business problem or societal need at all.  In the worst cases, ill-conceived   citizenship marketing strategies can result in  damaging consequences.   Practitioners must be pragmatic when engaging in  marketing social change.   Understanding how to apply best practice, identify  opportunities, address   challenges, engage stakeholders and innovate  strategically are essential   skills in this rapidly evolving sector. The purpose  of this course is to   provide students with an in-depth understanding of how  marketing principles   can be applied to create both short-term and lasting social  change. Students   will explore dimensions of the modern landscapes of brand,  corporate and   nonprofit \"citizenship\" and how they relate to marketing. Areas of  study   include: cause-related marketing and cause branding; nonprofit branding  and   social movements, as well as corporate social responsibility and shared  value   creation. ",

While the 19th century was characterized  by limits of human capital and the 20th century was limited by  financial  capital, the 21st century will be limited by natural capital. Shared and  improperly priced renewable resources (such as the air, the oceans and clean   water) are being threatened by climate change and a host of other  challenges. Other renewable resources (such as forests and fish stocks) are  being consumed faster than they can be replenished and non-renewable  resources (such as oil and  metals) are being depleted faster than any time  in human history. At the same time, transparency (enabled by technology),  new modes of communication, and an ever increasing number of NGOs, are  elevating consumer expectations of corporations. Finally, regulation is  expanding in response to market  inefficiencies and as a means of addressing  externalities. While all of these changes are happening outside the walls of  the corporation, they are so profound that they require a reexamination of  the past modes of leadership and management inside the enterprise. For  starters, leaders must reconsider the mission of their enterprise and  identify and prioritize the  stakeholders that the corporation is committed  to serve. In addition, leaders will be challenged to reimagine the  appropriate framework for the corporation, understanding newly extended  boundaries of responsibility. Thoughtful leaders will also look around  corners to try to understand the inter-relationships of heretofore not  considered interactions and feedback loops.",

In order to  manage conflict effectively, managers need to understand what causes  conflict, how people behave in conflict, and how their responses influence  outcomes. In this course students will learn how to identify conflict,  assess its impact and respond accordingly. Students will compare different  systems of dispute resolution and how to best apply them in the workplace.  The course seeks to simulate this process by combining conceptual and  experiential approaches, involving exercises, case studies, lectures,  videos, feedback, and group work.

Students may enroll in Part I only, which will provide them with an  understanding of different approaches to design-based research.  Students cannot enroll in  LS802 without having taken LS801.  These courses are open to PhD students and, with the  permission of the instructors, EdM students.   Part I of this course introduces students to the varieties of design-based research methods  that have arisen over the last three decades as an important mode of educational inquiry and  theory development in the field of the learning sciences. These methods centrally involve the  orchestration and study of complex educational interventions in learning settings of various  kinds. Through a combination of readings, discussions, conversations with design-based  researchers at BU and other institutions, site visits, and class exercises, we will delve into  widely practiced models of design-based research, and consider the theoretical,  methodological and practical challenges of the models, including their relation to issues of  equity, diversity, and power in learning and teaching.

The students assume the role of clinical development teams at a hypothetical pharmaceutical company working to advance the development of a new vaccine. Each year, the class will select a vaccine candidate to enter development. Over the subsequent sessions, the students will advance their vaccine with the ultimate goal of securing licensure by FDA.  In this course, students will acquire a deep understanding of clinical development and the regulatory process, will learn about contemporary and historical aspects of vaccine development, clinical epidemiology, and infectious diseases.

This course examines the Constitutional, regulatory, political and socio-economic bases for the policies that determine access, quality, cost and equity in health services and population health programs. While the focus is principally on US examples, the course is structured on the World Health Organization's framework for organizing and analyzing national health systems, covering governance, financing, delivery systems, workforce, and human and other resources. The course combines intensive individual preparation for each class using both written and video materials, interactive class presentations and hands-on individual and group projects in laboratory sessions.

        "description": "There is abundant evidence in public health that one of the most effective ways to improve population health is by changing the policies and structures that set the contexts in which people make their decisions about health, and through which they access their health care. To change these policies and structures, public health professionals should be familiar with existing techniques and technologies for mobilizing and expressing popular support and pressure within existing policy frameworks that often seem unresponsive to community-based public health concerns.   This course introduces students to two key areas of knowledge in public health practice: 1) the principles and methods of community organizing and 2) campaigning for policy and structural change. A series of short assignments culminates in a final product: the creation of a campaign plan for changing public policy regarding a specific public health problem. Students will also choose an actual campaign, volunteer with that campaign, and use the course materials to reflect critically on their campaign experience.  The course is very practical, focusing on how to mobilize the right people at the right time to change public policies to promote health. It complements other courses in the school that look at the structure of policy processes (PM 760), and how to do health advocacy and frame policy campaigns at federal and state levels (SB 860). ",

The number of reported  EIDs is steadily increasing and some EIDs (e.g., influenza, chikungunya,  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] and, recently, SARS-CoV-2)  have had enormous global public health impact.  Localized outbreaks can often  be quite severe, particularly in certain settings (e.g., Ebola in West Africa  and COVID-19 in China).  EIDs are vector-borne and/or zoonotic, and a wide  range of social, behavioral, and physical environmental factors contribute to  their emergence. In this class, case studies of specific EIDs are used to  illustrate the multi-factorial nature of disease emergence and spread.  Emphasis is on understanding the natural history and pathogenesis of these  EIDs, and the laboratory methods commonly used for their diagnosis and  surveillance. At the course conclusion, students will be able to apply the  principles they have learned to analyze and determine the factors involved in  the new emergence or re-emergence of an infectious disease; essential  knowledge for determining appropriate control and prevention strategies.",

Students select a health care problem/policy of their choice to research and potentially solve. This will involve students' examining the barriers and facilitators to achieving quality health care as described in this policy, and conducting field-based interviews with experts in this area to learn more about their perspectives on this health care problem. Using the Chronic Care Model, students will describe a new policy that meets the IOM's Six Aims for Improvement or 10 Rules for Redesign. Then, using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, students will discuss the steps needed to bring their new policy into action. Written and group work, self-reflections, peer review, a professional presentation, and a final policy brief compose the graded assignments during this course",

        "description": "This foundation course teaches the clinical skills needed at various stages of the helping process (i.e., engagement, assessment, goal-setting and treatment planning, intervention and termination), whether the client is an individual, group, or family. Clinical methods are highlighted--what the social worker purposefully does as s/he works with individual clients and larger systems (e.g., groups, families, and communities) and how the social worker reacts and interacts in the helping relationship.  The helping relationship is seen as requiring collaboration between clinician and client and the strategic use of clinical skills (e.g., strengthening rapport, assessing needs and strengths, reaching for feelings, identifying goals and expectations, setting limits) throughout the process. The helping relationship is also based on sound social work values and ethics, positive regard for the full range of human diversity, and dedication to social and economic justice.   While the course emphasizes ways that clinicians can help clients accomplish goals, it also emphasizes the value of the helping relationship as a vehicle for client growth. Because a major hallmark of effective social work practice is the ability to reflect on one's interactions with individual clients and larger client systems, this course highlights the need to develop the capacity for professional self-reflection (i.e., the ability to observe and critique one's actions in relation to clients, supervisors, and colleagues and the integration of personal and professional \"selves\").  Core concepts of individual, family, and group intervention, case management, short-term work, and crisis intervention are introduced.  Individual methods focus on developing and maintaining the helping relationship. Family methods focus on joining with the family as an entire system when multiple members are available, or when only an individual is available, intervening with the individual while considering influences and implications for the family system. Group work methods concentrate on group types, group formation, and group development.  ",

Three theoretical approaches guide this work: Cognitive (focusing on thoughts, feelings, and behavior), Behavioral (focusing on monitoring and reinforcing positive behavior), and Psychodynamic (focusing on dysfunctional childhood patterns repeated in the present). Using these perspectives, students analyze videotaped treatment sessions, demonstrate therapeutic approaches through classroom skill-practice, and present cases from their field internships for analysis and discussion.

They also develop skills for forming and leading groups. The Mutual-Aid model provides the central organizing framework, showing the worker (a) how to mediate between and among three domains-- individual member, the group as a whole, and the environment,  (b) how to respond to dynamics such as transference, countertransference, and issues of power and control, and (c) how to promote client and group empowerment. Building on knowledge and skills from CP 759 (Introduction to Clinical Practice), students learn how to use themselves effectively with diverse populations, in various community and clinical settings, and with differing member problems and concerns.  Social and environmental stressors on group members and the group as a whole are considered at all stages of group development and with a variety of group types. Since social workers must have the capacity to assume varying roles in groups, students learn to shift the nature of their participation depending on the situation, for example, to be a colleague in an interdisciplinary team of care providers, to be the leader of a neighborhood task force, and to be a clinician providing psycho-educational services to the parents of mentally ill clients.  The greatest opportunity for skill development in this course occurs when students take initiative to organize, lead, or co-lead groups in their placement, and all are encouraged to do so, if this is possible within the nature of the placement.

Students will   learn family systems concepts and theories that are foundational to the   practice of family assessment and intervention. A conceptual framework,   Liberation Health, will be used to assist students in understanding families   within the larger socio-political-cultural context. Students will also learn   Structural Family Therapy as an exemplar of a family systems intervention.   Skill practice and exercises will illustrate (a) individual versus systemic   thinking, and (b) the meaning of the symptom in the system. An important   outcome is that students will be able to facilitate communication among   family members. As part of this work, students will deepen their ability to   build alliances with the family as a whole, assess families using common   family assessment tools, and develop hypotheses about the family's   experiences, structure and internal dynamics that may have affected the   presenting problem. Students will practice family intervention techniques   such as circular questioning, maintaining multiple alliances simultaneously,   encouraging family members to speak directly to each other, contracting and   goal setting, strengthening the caregiver subsystem, exploring the meaning   of missing members, and identifying important family secrets and myths.   Emphasis is placed on the clinician's use of self in working with diverse   individuals and families who present with a range of problems. ",

The CBT treatment and session structure, format, and planning is emphasized. Several intervention methods are illustrated and practiced using case examples, video and \"live\" demonstrations and role plays. These include a variety of reinforcement procedures, assertiveness and social skills training, problem-solving, behavioral activation, exposure procedures (desensitization treatment of anxiety) and cognitive treatments (e.g., cognitive restructuring, working with automatic thoughts and core beliefs). Students distinguish cognitive and behavioral theories as to how they inform a case formulation and selection of intervention. As cognitive behavior change must be transparent and collaborative, special attention is also paid to the client/therapist relationship, application of CBT methods for diverse populations, and ethical issues. Students learn to search and discuss empirical findings regarding effective CBT interventions as well as evaluate the effectiveness of assessments and cognitive and behavioral treatment methods relevant to their client's target problem. Students present their own cases from their field placements to be used in discussion of CBT assessment and intervention methods for specific problems/disorders in order to address the specific needs and considerations relevant to the clientele being served.",

Use of in-class and videotaped role plays along with small group exercises will help students become more creative, flexible,  and accountable in their approaches to treatment, and will direct students away from a deficit (pathology) model towards a resource (possibility) treatment model. Students learn to collaborate with clients to create well-formed treatment goals, and to measure change as it occurs over time.

A biopsychosocial model of  psychopathology is emphasized as we study some of the disorders classified in  the DSM-5, including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, psychotic disorders,  PTSD, dissociative disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, and  substance abuse/addictions. Complex factors in the etiology of various disorders  are considered, including genetic, neurochemical, biological, developmental,  familial, sociocultural, and political variables that affect the occurrence,  presentation, course, and treatment of a problem.  While learning the  perspective and language of the phenomenological approach outlined in the DSM-5,  we also highlight weaknesses and blind spots in the traditional approach to  diagnoses.  In particular, we explore the impact of oppression and bias on the  naming and treatment of mental disorders, including the influences of race,  gender, sexual orientation, class, disability, religion, and ethnicity on the  diagnostic process.  Students learn to consider the DSM-5 classification system  as a social construction that reveals as much about the society and its views of  human behavior as it does about the clients with whom social workers have  contact.    While this course is not designed to focus on treatment, students  have the opportunity to consider how diagnoses inform treatment and review  current research on both biological and psychosocial treatments for different  disorders.  Finally, we seek to enhance empathic understanding of our clients  experiences and the experiences of their families and loved ones, remembering  that people are not their diagnoses, that what is labeled individual pathology  may be an adaptive response to oppressive external circumstances, and that  people who experience a breakdown in functioning demonstrate not only  difficulties but also compelling strengths.  This course employs lecture, large  and small group discussion, case presentations, and videotapes.  Clinical  vignettes from instructors and class are used to illustrate mental disorders and  theoretical perspectives, and make material relevant to clinical practice,  particularly with urban populations",

In this course, developmental, systemic, psychodynamic, neurobiological and behavioral theoretical perspectives inform students? understanding of children and adolescents? adaptive and maladaptive patterns of behavior, which evolve over time in the context of their complex developmental histories and socio-cultural relational experiences.  The course promotes the importance of assessing in children and families both the historical and present risks for disturbed behavioral development and the historical and present protective factors that promote healthy and resilient behavioral development.  Implied throughout the course curriculum is the perspective that a deep understanding of children?s adaptations to stress and trauma is central in the social worker?s role of making informed and accurate assessments and diagnostic evaluations of children, adolescents, and families.  Discussion of clinical case material and relevant research assists students in learning to assess children and adolescents? current, unique developmental needs and strengths with a goal of empowering them to find pathways of behavior that better meet these developmental needs and give freedom to the deepening of these strengths. 3 cr.",

These kinds of vocational questions are fundamental to our lives.  The course seeks to  open  up reflection, study, and dialogue about vocation, work, and  spirituality in religious traditions and  in our  own life experience. Work and vocation are often  connected. Work too is a crucial religious  question in  contemporary society. Work exerts a  powerful--and often unrecognized--influence on  human beings. It  can support life, develop  talents, elicit creativity, and enable people to contribute to  the common good.  Work also can  demean human beings, undermining their dignity, perpetuating  unjust structures,   overpowering values, and crowding out other important spheres of life. Labor issues  are  important  concerns for faith communities and faith-based community organizations. This  course explores vocation  and work as theological/spiritual issues, including implications for   ministry. We will explore themes such  as: work as spiritual practice or challenge; labor and  justice  issues; discerning vocation; creativity;  Sabbath; \"time poverty\"; and work-life balance.  The course  involves site visits, vocational mentoring,  seminar presentations, and individual  research/ministry  projects. (Clusters 2 and 3)",

Through    analyzing various concepts of    postcolonial theologies and investigating    historical sociocultural religious practices in    postcolonialism, class, race    and sex/gender, students will critically reflect on    challenging conditions of    power and privilege and engage with the complexities of    postcolonial    theological practices.

In  particular, the course seeks to understand the historic perspectives   and approaches of African  American and Womanist readings and appropriations of   biblical texts as a way to build  students' capacities to appreciate the   interpretative strategies of others (especially  historically marginalized   and/or underrepresented groups) as well as to identify and articulate  their own   critical and socially-situated understandings of biblical passages and its    implications.

This kind of  empathic identification is important for good ethical practice  in diverse and pluralistic  communities. Narrative works of art are important for developing the human  self- understanding critical for embodying certain religious and theological ideals. This course will   explore the connections between literature (novels, plays, and short stories) and ethics: the  relationship  between creative imagination and moral imagination; the nature of moral  attention and moral vision; the  role of context-specific judging in ethical decisions. The  course will help students to deepen and  broaden their ethical understanding in ways that  involve and give priority to context-specific moral  evaluation, compassion, similar possibilities  and vulnerabilities, eudaimonistic judgment, rather than  abstract general principles for ethical  judgment.

This course provides an  overview of the  historical development of the   world's religions in order to better understand   the current spiritual pluralism of North America.

The course will focus on both the  emic (inner    dimensions) and etic (outer dimensions) of the historical and spiritual   development of the world's   religions. We will stress the differences as well as  the similar  features of the religions. We will also ask   genuine theological  questions because we live,  work, communicate and minister in diverse religious    communities of faith. (Requires TF  701/TF 702 as prerequisite.)
